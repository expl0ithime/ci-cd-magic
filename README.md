# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

🛠️ This is a simple continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline built with GitHub Actions.

## 🧠 What This Does

This pipeline:
- Automatically runs tests (or mock tests) when code is pushed
- Builds the app (placeholder for now)
- Deploys (or simulates deployment)

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```
.github/workflows/main.yml
README.md
```

## 📦 Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- YAML
- Git
- (More tools coming soon...)

## ✨ Why I Made This

I’m building out a DevOps portfolio from the ground up. This shows I understand automation, pipelines, and collaboration.

🎯 Version 1.0  # Woke up the pipeline 🌞
